    <h1>Dice Wars Project</h1>

    <h3>A JavaScript game and project to teach programming through game creation</h3>

    <h3>by Kasey Chang</h3>


    <P>An idea came to me when reading reddit.com/r/learnprogramming in that a lot of people who start programming are completely lost. They don't see how to apply what they learned. I thought I would give them something simple, then gradually adding more
        and more to it until it became a full game. </P>

    <P>I chose the simple little dice game called Dice Wars, and the Dice Wars Project was born. </P>

    <P>Right now, the project has three chapters, with a few more chapters coming soon. Each chapter has a corresponding blog entry. Starting with simple Bootstrap starter code, this also introduces the programmer to jQuery DOM manipulation, Bootstrap grid,
        and various JavaScript functions and how to use them. </P>


    <h3>Chapter 1: The War Begins</h3>

    <P>This is the basic version which rolls 3 dice and displays the results.</P>

    <P>Source Code: <a href="https://github.com/kschang77/dicewars/blob/master/dicewars1.html">Link</a></P>

    <P>Demo: <a href="https://kschang77.github.io/dicewars/dicewars1.html">Link</a></P>


    <h3>Chapter 2: The War Intensifies</h3>

    <P>This completes the game, even though it is very plain looking. There is a win/lose condition, and there is a reset.</P>

    <h3>Chapter 3: The War Enters a New Phase</h3>

    <P>This part deals with minor edits to the game to enhance playability and user interface to something a modern user would expect, like confirmation before reset, tooltips, etc. so it looks a lot better by using fontawesome (tm) icons for score and dice.</P>

    <h2>
        Coming soon
    </h2>

    <h3>Chapter 4: The War Expands</h3>

    <P>Change the functions to allow more parameters so game variants (different number of dice, different starting pieces, etc.) will be supported.</P>
