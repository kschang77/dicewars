# Welcome to Dice Wars project page

A project by Kasey Chang to illustrate some basic JavaScript concepts, and build them into a simple game. 

Then continue to polish it and give it more and more capabilities. 

Right now, the project has three chapters, with a few more chapters coming soon.

This is the basic version which rolls 3 dice and displays the results

This completes the game, even though it is very plain looking. There is a win/lose condition, and there is a reset.

This part deals with minor edits to the game to enhance playability and user interface to something a modern user would expect, like confirmation before reset, tooltips, etc. so it looks a lot better by using fontawesome (tm) icons for score and dice. 


## Coming soon

Chapter 4 -- change the functions to allow more parameters so game variants (different number of dice, different starting pieces, etc.) will be supported. 


Chapter 5 -- go graphical by using canvas, maybe?
